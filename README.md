# Integrity-And-Anti-Corruption
In this course, I realized that ethics and integrity are very important in my life. I learned about the effects of corruption on our society and economy. Through case studies and class discussions, I was able to understand the efforts made by Malaysia to address the problem of corruption.
In my opinion, using real-life examples and acting out scenarios, such as the video we performed, makes learning about integrity more interesting. It also helps students understand the importance of ethics in a more practical way. This course taught me that maintaining strong moral values and ethical principles in every action I take is essential. Without integrity, even excellent academic results would not be truly meaningful.
